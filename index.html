  <h2> Parametric Line Envelopes </h2>
  <p> This applet allows you to draw envelopes of families of lines, where the lines are defined by their endpoints which each have a parametric formula for x and y. </p>
  <p> It uses JavaScript's evaluations of functions, so type "sqrt(a)" to take a square root or "a**b" to take a power. The test function can be used to show that a guess for the envelope is correct, and the parameter L can be used in your equations/ranges. </p>
  <p> Type the points or ranges exactly as shown (e.g. "0,t")</p>
